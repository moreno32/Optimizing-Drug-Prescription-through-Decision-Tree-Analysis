# Optimizing Drug Prescription through Decision Tree Analysis

## 🔄 Overview:
In this project, we aim to develop a model that can predict the most appropriate medication for a new patient based on their medical profile. Using a dataset that contains patient characteristics such as age, sex, blood pressure, and cholesterol, we will build a decision tree classifier to find the relationship between these features and the patients' response to different drugs.

## 🎊 Motivation:
With the increasing demand for personalized medicine, the ability to predict the most effective drug for a patient is becoming increasingly important. This project provides a method for optimizing drug prescription and improving patient outcomes.

## 🏁 Learning Objectives:
1)	Understanding of decision tree algorithms and their applications in multiclass classification problems
2)	Experience in pre-processing and feature selection for datasets
3)	Hands-on implementation of decision tree algorithms and evaluation of model performance
4)	Practice in visualizing and interpreting decision tree models

## ⚙️ Technical Aspects:
In this project, we will be using Python libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, scikit-learn, and scipy to pre-process, analyze, and visualize the data. The decision tree classifier will be implemented using the scikit-learn library.

## 🧰 Technology used:
The project will use Python, pandas, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, scikit-learn and scipy.

## 📚 Data Source:
A sample dataset of patients suffering from the same illness, including their age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol, and response to different drugs (Drug A, Drug B, Drug c, Drug x, and y).

## 🗂️ Project Structure:
The project will consist of the following stages.
1)	Importing and loading the data
2)	Pre-processing and feature selection
3)	Modeling with the decision tree algorithm
4)	Prediction and evaluation of model performance
5)	Visualization of the decision tree model
